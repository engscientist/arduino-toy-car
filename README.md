# Arduino Toy Car
A friend of mine and I are planning on making a vacuuming system using Arduino and Autodesk Fusion 360 in preparation for a very tough design course.

## Files
`sketch_jan22a.ino`: a draft Arduino code, without any modules installed.

`shaftjy1.stl`: STL file for the shaft drawn in Autodesk Fusion 360.

`wheeljy1.stl`: STL file for the wheel drawn in Autodesk Fusion 360.
